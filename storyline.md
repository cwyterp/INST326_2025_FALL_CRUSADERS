Welcome to your destiny.
In a world that was devasted by an infestation.
The land of the Cats was once a peaceful land.
Tabbys, Calicos, cats of every pattern and fur lived peacefully.
The many cats of the land lived in harmony with one another.
That is until a monstrous ring of rats appeared. 
They terrorized the lands and congregated power into four big rats.
One rat king above them all, while supported by its three vassals.
It is time for you to take a stand.
You wake up in the small town of Yarny. 
Set upon the path you are equipped with a few items.
A sword to attack with.
A shield to defend with.
A will to gather strength.
And the power to unleash that gathered strength.
Setting off on your journey you come across three paths.
The first houses a dense forest.
The second is a docking shore.
The third is a wide expanse of fields.
Where will you go?
