You have chosen to walk down the fielded path.
You walk across the fields as the grass sways in the wind.
The sky is clear as you walk along the path. 
You ready your sword as the sound of rats scurry through the fields. 
You stumble into a small clearing.
At the center is a giant rat.
One of the King's Vassals. 
Peter the Peaceful.
We wish for your victory.

After a long journey you are now faced with the Rat King's Castle.
You ready yourself for the final battle.
Opening the gats you wander into the expansive hall.
At the throne sits the Rat King.
We wish for your victory.
