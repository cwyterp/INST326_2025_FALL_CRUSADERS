You have chosen to walk down the forested path.
You walk into the forest as the light dims.
The sound of leaves rustling grows stronger.
You tense as you enter a small clearing.
At the center is a giant Rat.
One of the King's Vassals.
Aiten the Angered.
We wish for your victory.

Congratulations you have defeated one of the King's Vassals.
You walk across the fields as the grass sways in the wind.
The sky is clear as you walk along the path. 
You ready your sword as the sound of rats scurry through the fields. 
You stumble into a small clearing.
At the center is a giant rat.
One of the King's Vassals. 
Peter the Peaceful.
We wish for your victory.

Congratulations you have defeated two of the King's Vassals.
Boarding a boat you begin to sail.
The waters rock high and low as the winds bob you up and down.
As you sail the winds begin to pick up.
The sound of thunder can be heard.
Up aheada large blob rises from the water.
At the break of the water a giant rat appears.
One of the King's Vassals.
Doug the Defense.
We wish for your victory.
