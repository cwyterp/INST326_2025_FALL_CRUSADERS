Welcome to your destiny.
In a world that was devasted by an infestation.
The land of the Cats was once a peaceful land.
Tabbys, Calicos, cats of every pattern and fur lived peacefully.
The many cats of the land lived in harmony with one another.
That is until a monstrous ring of rats appeared.
They terrorized the lands and congregated power into four big rats.
One rat king above them all, while supported by its three vassals.
Someone must journey to eliminate all of the King's Vassals and finally, the King itself.
It is time for you to take a stand.
You wake up in the small town of Yarny.
Set upon the path you are equipped with a few items.
A sword to attack with.
A shield to defend with.
A will to gather strength.
And the power to unleash that gathered strength.
Setting off on your journey you come across three paths.
The first wide expanse of fields.
The second is a docking shore.
The third is a dense forest.
A: A wide expanse of fields.
B: A docking shore.
C: A dense forest.
Where will you go?

After a long journey you are now faced with the Rat King's Castle.
You ready yourself for the final battle.
Opening the gats you wander into the expansive hall.
At the throne sits the Rat King.
We wish for your victory.
